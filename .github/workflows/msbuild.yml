# Helper expression functions are not native — to avoid breaking on missing files we used download-artifact with warnings and conditional uploads.
# If you prefer stricter checks or dynamic enumerations of files to upload, replace the conditional steps with a short shell script that enumerates and uploads using the GitHub REST API or `gh` cli.
